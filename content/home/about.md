# Biography
My research is aimed at our understanding the future climate: what can we expect and why?

Currently, I am determing the effect of Antarctic ice sheet melt on climate projections, as well how the melt interacts with Southern Ocean wind stress changes. This research is aimed to highlight the role of the Southern Ocean in future climate projections, and test how model-dependent the results are as part of the Southern Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (SOMIP).

Previous work includes Southern Ocean air-sea carbon fluxes, changes in Southern Ocean nutrient upwelling and its effect on oxygen minimum zones and the Revelle Buffer Factor, ocean anthropogenic carbon uptake in models and observations, and ocean heat redistribition by circulation changes and the similarities between ocean heat and carbon uptake.
